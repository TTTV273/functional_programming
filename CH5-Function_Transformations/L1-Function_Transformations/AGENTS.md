# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `main.py`: Lesson code and entry point for running examples.
- `Lesson.md`: Problem statement, background, and instructions (do not change semantics).
- `__pycache__/`: Generated bytecode; ignore in reviews.

Keep lesson code small and readable. Prefer adding helper functions inside `main.py` unless the lesson explicitly calls for new modules.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Run lesson: `python3 main.py` â€” executes the examples and prints logs.
- Create venv (optional): `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`.

No external dependencies are required for this lesson; avoid adding packages unless discussed.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 4 spaces; target Python 3.10+ semantics.
- Style: Follow PEP 8. Keep functions pure when possible; avoid hidden I/O.
- Naming: `snake_case` for functions/variables. For formatter examples, use the pattern `*_delimit` (e.g., `colon_delimit`).
- Imports: Prefer standard library only. Keep imports at the top of `main.py` if needed.

## Testing Guidelines
- This repo has no formal test suite. Validate behavior by running `python3 main.py` and inspecting output.
- Add minimal, focused helper functions with docstring examples when useful.
- If you introduce new behavior, include a small reproducible example in `main.py` under a guarded block or function used by `main()`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Use clear, present-tense summaries similar to existing history.
  - Example: `Complete CH5-L1 function transformation logger with inner closure`
- Scope: Keep changes tightly focused on this lesson; avoid cross-lesson refactors.
- Pull Requests should include:
  - Purpose and short summary of the approach.
  - Before/after output snippets from `python3 main.py` when applicable.
  - Any risks or follow-ups (e.g., changed print format).

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not add network calls, credentials, or file writes; lessons should be deterministic and local.
- Keep outputs stable; downstream exercises may rely on exact strings.
- If environment details matter, state them briefly (e.g., Python version) in the PR description.
