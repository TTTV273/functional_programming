Start a new functional programming lesson: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:
1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand current learning progress and completed chapters
2. Query Neo4j memory for LEARNING-SPECIFIC data only:
   - Programming_Skills: current level, strengths, areas for improvement
   - Learning_Interests: preferred learning methods and focus areas
   - System_Setup: development environment and workflow preferences
   - Active_Projects: relevant coding projects for context
3. Analyze the target lesson's Lesson.md file for core concepts and Vietnamese explanations
4. Examine main.py structure and main_test.py for implementation requirements
5. Create personalized learning approach based on programming background and learning preferences
6. Begin implementation using pure function principles and test-driven development
7. Update Neo4j memory with lesson-specific progress only (no personal data)
8. Update progress tracking in CLAUDE.md

Remember to prioritize Vietnamese technical explanations and connect concepts to previous programming experience.
