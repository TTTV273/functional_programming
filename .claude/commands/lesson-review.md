Review and reinforce completed functional programming lesson: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:
1. Re-read the lesson's Lesson.md file for concept reinforcement and Vietnamese explanations
2. Analyze the completed main.py implementation for functional programming patterns used
3. Connect lesson concepts to general software development applications (avoid specific business references)
4. Update Neo4j memory with LEARNING-SPECIFIC data only:
   - Add lesson completion to Programming_Skills.observations
   - Record new functional programming concepts mastered
   - Note learning insights and pattern recognition improvements
   - Document any challenging areas that required extra attention
   - STRICT RULE: Only add technical learning data, no personal context
5. Update CLAUDE.md with key learning points and pattern connections to previous lessons
6. Create a descriptive commit message summarizing lesson review insights and progress
7. Push changes to GitHub to maintain learning progress backup

Remember to focus on pattern recognition, connecting concepts to previous lessons for long-term retention, and documenting learning insights rather than additional testing.
