# Neo4j Memory Update Protocol

## Command: Update Neo4j Memory

```
Please update the Neo4j memory with: $ARGUMENTS.
Follow these steps:

1. Use `read_graph` to get current state and verify entity exists
2. Analyze what type of update is needed (add/modify/remove)
3. Search for related entities that might be affected
4. Implement the update using appropriate method:
   - For new info: `add_observations` 
   - For corrections: `delete_observations` then `add_observations`
   - For new connections: `create_relations`
5. Verify no duplicates or conflicts were created
6. Check observation count stays ‚â§5 per entity
7. Consolidate if any entity becomes bloated
8. Read graph again to confirm successful update

Remember to maintain the 7-entity structure for optimal performance.
```

## Quick Update Templates

### üìö Learning Update
```
Update Neo4j: Learned $TOPIC from $SOURCE.
Steps:
1. Check `Programming_Skills` current observations
2. If count ‚â• 4, remove oldest non-core skill
3. Add new learning as concise observation
4. Update relation to `AI_Development` if relevant
5. Verify workspace path still accurate
```

### üöÄ Project Progress  
```
Update Neo4j: Project $NAME status is $STATUS.
Steps:
1. Check `Active_Projects` for existing entry
2. If completed:
   - Extract key achievement ‚Üí `AI_Development`
   - Remove from `Active_Projects`
3. If new: Add to `Active_Projects` (max 4 concurrent)
4. Update income relation to `Business_Operations` if applicable
5. Verify total active projects ‚â§ 4
```

### üíª Tech Stack Change
```
Update Neo4j: Changed $TOOL to $NEW_TOOL for $REASON.
Steps:
1. Read `System_Setup` observations
2. Find and remove old tool reference
3. Add new tool with context (e.g., "VSCode ‚Üí Cursor for AI features")
4. Update `Programming_Skills` if affects workflow
5. Check no orphaned dependencies remain
```

### üí∞ Business Update
```
Update Neo4j: Business change - $DESCRIPTION.
Steps:
1. Check `Business_Operations` current state
2. Update relevant observation (rent/revenue/costs)
3. If new income source, add relation from `Active_Projects`
4. Keep financial data aggregated, not detailed
5. Archive old contracts/deals after completion
```

### üè• Health Status
```
Update Neo4j: Health update - $CONDITION.
Steps:
1. Read `Health_Status` observations
2. Keep only most recent treatment/diagnosis
3. Update routine if changed
4. Maintain equipment list only if actively used
5. Max 4 observations total
```

## Batch Update Protocol

### üîÑ Weekly Maintenance
```
Perform Neo4j weekly maintenance.
Steps:
1. Read full graph
2. For each entity with >4 observations:
   - Identify outdated info
   - Consolidate similar observations
   - Delete redundant data
3. Check for orphaned relations
4. Archive completed projects
5. Update `User` entity if personal info changed
6. Generate summary of changes made
```

### üéØ Focus Area Shift
```
Update Neo4j: Shifting focus from $OLD_AREA to $NEW_AREA.
Steps:
1. Identify affected entities (usually 2-3)
2. Archive/reduce $OLD_AREA observations
3. Create space for $NEW_AREA content
4. Update relations to reflect new priorities
5. Ensure `Active_Projects` aligns with new focus
6. Keep total entity count at 7
```

## Error Recovery

### üîß Fix Duplicate Data
```
Fix Neo4j: Found duplicate - $DESCRIPTION.
Steps:
1. Search both entities/observations
2. Identify which has more recent data
3. Merge unique info from both
4. Delete duplicate entity/observation
5. Update relations to point to merged entity
6. Verify graph integrity
```

### üóëÔ∏è Clean Obsolete Data
```
Clean Neo4j: Remove obsolete $CATEGORY data.
Steps:
1. Identify observations older than 3 months
2. Check if still relevant/active
3. For obsolete items:
   - Extract any achievements
   - Delete detailed progress
   - Keep only outcomes
4. Reduce each entity to ‚â§4 observations
5. Verify essential info preserved
```

## Validation Checklist

After any update, verify:
- [ ] Total entities = 7 (no more, no less)
- [ ] Each entity has ‚â§5 observations
- [ ] No duplicate information across entities
- [ ] Relations make semantic sense
- [ ] User entity has core info only
- [ ] Active projects ‚â§ 4
- [ ] Technical domains are current
- [ ] Business data is aggregated

## Example Usage

```bash
# Learning update
"Update Neo4j: Learned Advanced Prompting from Anthropic docs."

# Project completion  
"Update Neo4j: GAIA Solver project completed with 85% accuracy."

# System change
"Update Neo4j: Switched from i3wm to Hyprland for better animations."

# Health improvement
"Update Neo4j: Back pain improved, stopped medication, continuing exercises."

# Business milestone

```

## Performance Metrics

Target after update:
- Query time: <100ms
- Memory usage: <1MB
- Observations total: <30
- Relations total: <10
- Update time: <2s
